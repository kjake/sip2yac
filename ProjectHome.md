## About ##
sip2yac uses [libPcap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap) to scan network traffic for [SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) INVITE messages and forwards them to [YAC](http://sunflowerhead.com/software/yac/) listener(s).

If your [SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol)/[VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol) provider does not provide CallerID Name (CNAM/CIDNAME) info, the phone number is submitted to multiple [reverse lookup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_telephone_directory) services.

Originally created for [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com/) and folks at [SageTV](http://sage.tv/), it eventually became obvious that this has a greater audience.

### History ###
This was a [perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) script originally came from the [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) mailing list and was written specifically for [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/).  This version allows users to run it on Windows and with [YAC](http://sunflowerhead.com/software/yac/), a desktop callerID popup utility.
